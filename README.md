#### [Episode 192 | How to Make Your SaaS App More Contagious](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-192-how-to-make-your-saas-app-more-contagious)

##### [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](smile.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products-ebook/dp/B00HJ4A43S)

Author: Nir Eyal

Mentioned By: Rob

> The other thing I had was I read a couple other books that I wanted to mention. One is called Hooked. And it’s about how to make your app or your game or you’re whatever  you’r ebuilding more like addictive. Kind of how to keep people coming back and using it and if you hear about this book I liked it reasonably well. What I didn’t like is almost all the examples were were consumer stuff. It is all about viral videos. It was about iPhone app games. It was about stuff like that and I really had a tough time trying to apply it to our space.

##### [Contagious: Why Things Catch On](smile.amazon.com/Contagious-Things-Catch-Jonah-Berger/dp/1451686579)

Author: Jonah Berger

Mentioned By: Rob

> Instead of reading Hooked, I would recommend reading a book called Contagious. And that’s more about why things catch on and how to make your things more viral. And that’s actually what we’re…That’s what the whole outline is pulled from Contagious. Unless you are doing B2C stuff I would stay away from Hooked. 

##### [The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](smile.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)

Author: Ben Horowitz

Mentioned By: Rob

> The other book that I just read is called The Hard Thing About Hard Things. It’s written by Ben Horowitz, who is, you know, a venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz. This was a gut wrenching tale of him basically growing a company, having it almost go bankrupt multiple times. Not having funding and then selling. It’s  it’s a crazy crazy tale about his perseverance. I recommended if you just want to get into the dirt. It is a dark book because you feel his pain, like I actually got sad at several points. I got really tied into his story. So it’s gut wrenching. It’s not a feel good tale by any means but it definitely teaches you a lot about perhaps what it take to succeed at that level. And have a multi billion dollar exit. And frankly, I want no part of it. I’ve always thought that anyways. But in listening to this book…Yup. I wouldn’t of wanted to do that. I wouldn’t have wanted to put myself , my family, my friends just put your body mentally and physically through that ordeals, but it is definitely an interesting story about a big venture capital raise and exit.

##### [Predictable Revenue: Turn Your Business Into a Sales Machine with the $100 Million Best Practices of Salesforce.com](smile.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213)

Author: Aaron Ross

Mentioned By: Rob

> It’s written by a guy or one of the guys who built the sales pipeline or the sales force at salesforce.com, and it’s an interesting book. I found that I got a little bit out of the first couple of chapters, but overall it’s about scaling a sales organization, so if you are not going to be scaling a sales organization, I would not recommend this book. He does have something early on and he hints at cold calling 2.0, and he talks about it and you are all intrigued and he really builds it up, and then when he gets to it, it’s cold emailing, it is getting a list of people and cold emailing them with a certain technique and I am like oh that was a big let down, I  imagined that they maybe partially responsible for all the cold emails I get pitching me different products now, it’s not spam technically right it’s not stuff that it is getting spam, but it is people sending it through like YesWare and Tout app and that kind of a stuff, overall probably for our audience not really worth reading.

##### [Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal](smile.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591846013)

Author: Nick Bilton

Mentioned By: Rob

> I think I mentioned it in our previous broadcast and a very, very good story of the beginnings of Twitter, and just all the chaos, the soap opera that went along with that.

##### [Things a Little Bird Told Me: Confessions of the Creative Mind](smile.amazon.com/Things-Little-Bird-Told-Confessions/dp/1455528714)

Author: Biz Stone

Mentioned By: Rob

> The other one that I just listened to is called Things A Little Bird Told Me, and this is Biz Stone, he is one of the co-founders of Twitter, it’s kind of his story, it’s a life story, and so his early stories aren’t as interesting as you know once he starts doing tech stuff, but he does a good job of kind of taking lessons away from different parts of his life, and linking them into his startup success. I have a lot of respect for Biz, he just seems to be, seems to be a hardworking legitimate guy, he didn’t stab much people in the back, I guess I have respect for him, so Things A Little Bird Told To Me is good, but I definitely would recommend you add it to you Audible list.

##### [Contagious: Why Things Catch On](smile.amazon.com/Contagious-Things-Catch-Jonah-Berger/dp/1451686579)

Author: Jonah Berger

Mentioned By: Rob

> The last one I will talk about is another one that I would recommend, and when it started off it is called Contagious, when it started off, I was thinking you know this is just like every other book about virality, and it’s going to focus solely on B2C stuff, and it’s all about viral videos, and it’s about the blend tech, you know will blend videos and it’s about that kind of stuff and to be honest it did have a lot of B2C leanings, but what I found is that he lays out five discrete steps, that makes something contagious, but what I liked about it is that, just listening to it I almost turned it off but once I started taking each of the points he talked about, when I started specifically applying it to Drip. It really started making a difference, and I actually was able to take a bunch of notes from it, like actual action steps, that I am going to either think about with Drip, or that I am going to implement on Drip and it’s ways to make it something that is easier for people to talk about and makes it more interesting for people who are using it, so I think if you have a product and you can apply this to it even if you are not in a B2C niche. I think Contagious is good for you.  I think if you don’t have a product, and you are still kind of looking to launch or pre-launch or whatever I don’t think it’s going to necessarily give you a lot of value.

##### [7-Day Startup Book](http://wpcurve.com/7daystartup)

Author: Dan Norris

Mentioned By: Dan

> Yeah and I contacted you guys recently because I’ve sort of written a book that talks about that journey that I went through about that failing business and what I got right with the current business and it talks about the validation aspect and the book’s called The Seven Day Startup so it’s about launching quickly and I think what we’re going to talk about today is some of those lessons.

#### [Episode 179 | When to Ask Your Customers for Credit Cards](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-179-when-to-ask-your-customers-for-credit-cards)

##### [The Customer Support Handbook: How to Create the Ultimate Customer Experience for Your Brand](http://smile.amazon.com/The-Customer-Support-Handbook-Experience/dp/0615962017)

Author: Sarah Hatter

Mentioned By: Mike

> Hey, I asked someone to point out – if anyone follows Sarah Hatter and her team over at Cosupport, they just launched a new book called The Customer Support Handbook. They started selling it I think back in December and they were basically selling pre-released copies of it that came bundled with a basket and all these atomic fireballs and various other things. But you can go out to Amazon right now and get it and we’ll link that up in the show notes. I kind of glanced through it yesterday when I got my copy of it. It looks pretty detailed so far. I think that Sarah’s got a really good handle on customer support and if you don’t know who she is, she handled the customer support for 37 Signals for a long time before she kind of struck on her own and created the company Cosupport.

#### [Episode 175 | Your Product is Not the Hero (with Chase Reeves)](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-175-your-product-is-not-the-hero-with-chase-reeves)

##### [The Customer Support Handbook: How to Create the Ultimate Customer Experience for Your Brand](http://smile.amazon.com/Million-Miles-Thousand-Years-Learned/dp/1400202981)

Author: Donald Miller

Mentioned By: Chase

> My friend Don Miller wrote a book called A Million Miles in a Thousand Years. He’s basically asking what would happen if we looked out are life the way that a director looked at a movie? And that’s always stucked with me because – then he gets into what is a story? This is a simple formula for that. A story is a character who wants something and overcomes obstacles to get it. So I always try to get myself in a story mode but here’s the big mistake that all of us founders end up making. It’s like so if the story of our business is like Star Wars. We always think of ourselves as Luke Skywalker but we’re not Luke. The audience is Luke. The person who’s using our software is Luke.

##### [Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal](http://smile.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854)

Author: Oren Klaff

Mentioned By: Rob

> The first one is called Pitch Anything. It’s a really well written book. Specifically if you’re going to be doing in person either negotiations or sales or pitching, stuff like that, it’s fascinating about the dynamics of how to take the frame of a meeting and how great stories in there and just a great way of thinking about how to come into a room with other people and to take control of the situation if you need to, or to give it up if you need to.

##### [The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work](http://smile.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633)

Author: Scott Berkun 

Mentioned By: Rob

> I read pretty much all the books that Scott has written. This one is about working for WordPress but frankly its working for Automatic which is kind of the parent company of WordPress. He worked for a year. There’s not a ton of actionable stuff. I think folks kind of in our circles will have heard a lot because a lot of it is about remote teams and working remotely and it is a lot of storytelling project management building software I mean that’s kind of cool thing. But with all that said there are some interesting characters in there. It’s definitely a nice story, Scott toes a good job of communicating it. So if you like stories like the Hatch of Twitter, startup stories of Amazon and that kind of stuff, The Year Without Pants is a good one to add to your collection.
